            <p>
                What ever happened to predictability? The milkman, the paperboy, evening TV. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there's a heart, a hand to hold onto. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go. There's a face of somebody who needs you.
                Everywhere you look, when you're lost out there and you're all alone, a light is waiting to carry you home, Everywhere you look. Everywhere you look.
